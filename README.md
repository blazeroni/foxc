# FoXC

FoXC was an turn-based strategy game demo/proof-of-concept project created in 2006.  It currently exists only as a historical curiosity.

## Status

This project was migrated from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/foxc/) with the sole intent of preserving it.  No updates or changes are planned.

## Run it

* Download the [release](https://github.com/blazeroni/foxc/releases/download/v0.1/foxc_0_1.zip) and extract it
* Run `server.exe`
* Run `client.exe`
* Be amazed :smirk:

### Play it

You can host a lobby, outfit a squad, load a few maps, move your soldiers around the map, use your weapons/items, use grenades to destroy walls, etc.  Most of it should be, if not intuitive, at least discoverable just clicking around.  The main exception is that `spacebar` ends the turn for your current unit.

:bug: Though the game is supposed to support multiple players, the released executable only works with a single player.  The included maps were edited to allow just one player.

## Build it

Don't.  The code isn't going to build as-is and would require re-creating an appropriate enviroment and tracking down libraries referenced in code with unspecified versions.  Not an impossible task, but not worth the trouble.
